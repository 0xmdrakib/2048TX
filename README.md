Just lunched my new and 7th @base mini app: 2048 TX 🧩🎮

I built a 2048 game where gameplay can optionally trigger real onchain activity:

✅ Classic Mode: play normally, then optionally submit a 0-cost tx to save your score onchain.
✅ Pay-per-move Mode: each move confirms a tiny randomized USDC transfer (0.000001$–0.000005$) to avoid identical tx patterns, this will help you to do tx on base chain while play game.
✅️ You can choise 4 UI theme, choose theme from top.
✅ And you can check weekly top 100 leaderboard.

🎯 Goal: make “fun” a reason to generate meaningful onchain usage — without bots or spammy UX.

I’d love feedback from the Base team. @jessepollak
